This project implements a basic statistics engine to calculate the Mean, Median, and Mode of a list of integers. The goal is to demonstrate how three different programming paradigms—Procedural, Functional, and Object-Oriented—solve the same problem using their unique strengths.

1. Procedural Approach (C)
Focuses on step-by-step instructions and manual memory management.
Key Feature: Uses a custom bubble sort and manual frequency counters.

2. Functional Approach (OCaml)
Focuses on mathematical transformations and data immutability.
Key Feature: Uses higher-order functions like fold and map instead of loops.

3. Object-Oriented Approach (Python)
Focuses on data encapsulation and modularity.
Key Feature: Bundles the dataset and statistical logic into a single StatisticsCalculator class.
